# autokeyscripts
My collection of scripts for AutoKey (not AutoHotKey)
I will be adding more. These scripts are more for adding function to applications rather than app switching. The use of F13-F24
keys are highly recommended.

Most of these scripts will be for TES Construction Set for Oblivion, if they require CS Extended I will note that

These scripts can be adapted to AutoHotKey, they are somewhat simple. It only requires some changes of functions and syntax.

These are public domain and I do accept any changes.
